This text-based adventure is a continuation of my 2021 [Christmas Challenge](https://victoriaderidder.github.io/achristmaschallenge/), but don't worry! It can stand alone.

Type 'skip' into any guess box to skip any riddle. Some are unsolvable without physical items.

If you're in a hurry, feel free to use the hamburger menu in the top left corner to navigate! (I think the starred items are the most interesting.)

If you had a great time playing, please feel free to check out the [2023 edition!](https://victoriaderidder.github.io/christmas2023/)
